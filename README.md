# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains implementations of machine learning projects based on various YouTube tutorials. The purpose of this repository is to **practice and reinforce machine learning concepts** by reproducing code from instructional videos.

## ðŸ“Œ Project: ROCK OR MINE (Sonar Signal Classification)
This project is a reproduction of a YouTube tutorial that demonstrates how to classify sonar signals as either **rock** or **mine** using machine learning techniques.
